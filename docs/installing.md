# Installing Superpowers

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Superpowers separately for each one.

> **Note for this fork.** Every command on this page installs **upstream Superpowers** from
> `obra/superpowers` and its marketplaces. None of them install this repository's NASA-SWE
> compliance layer, which is not published to any harness marketplace. For installing the fork
> itself, see [Installing](../README.md#installing) in the README.

## Claude Code

Superpowers is available via the [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

### Official Marketplace

  ```
  Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
  ```

- Detailed docs: [README.opencode.md](README.opencode.md)

## Pi

Install Superpowers as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/obra/superpowers
```

For local development, run Pi with this checkout loaded as a temporary package:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/superpowers
```

The Pi package loads the Superpowers skills and a small extension that injects the `using-superpowers` bootstrap at session startup and again after compaction. Pi has native skills, so no compatibility `Skill` tool is required. Subagent and task-list tools remain optional Pi companion packages.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.
